vim-apoklinon
=============

A dark 256 colour scheme for Vim


## Requirements

This colourscheme is intended for use on:

-   Vim 7.3 for Linux and Mac, using a 256 colour enabled terminal.

-   gVim 7.3 for Linux, Mac and Windows.

By default, Vim will use the closest matching cterm equivalent of the RGB
colours.

## Recommended terminal colours

Due to the limited 256 palette, colours in Vim and gVim will still be slightly
different. In order to get the same colours as gVim and use this colourscheme
the way that it was intended, it is highly recommended that you:

1.  Add these colours to ~/.Xresources:


2.  Use Xresources colours by setting in ~/.vimrc:

        let g:apoklinon_use_Xresources = 1
        colorscheme apoklinon

## Screenshots

Will some them up soon
